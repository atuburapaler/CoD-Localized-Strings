af_caves_load,14,17.5,^2MacTavish: ^7We've got one good UMP.  They've got a thousand.  
af_caves_load,18,21,^2MacTavish: ^7We don't even know if Makarov's intel's any good.  
af_caves_load,21.3,22.3,^2MacTavish: ^7Price. 
af_caves_load,23.3,24.3,^2MacTavish: ^7...Price?
af_caves_load,25,30.2,^2Price: ^7The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking this is its last day on Earth.   
af_caves_load,30.5,33.5,^2Price: ^7But I think that's a luxury.  Not a curse. 
af_caves_load,33.5,36.7,^2Price: ^7To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom. 
af_caves_load,37.5,40,^2Price: ^7Good time to take... inventory. 
af_caves_load,41,46,^2Price: ^7Outgunned.  Outnumbered.  Out of our minds. On a suicide mission. 
af_caves_load,46,50,^2Price: ^7But the sand and rocks here, stained with thousands of years of warfare...
af_caves_load,51.2,54,^2Price: ^7They will remember us.  For this.
af_caves_load,54.5,60,^2Price: ^7Because out of all our vast array of nightmares, this is the one we choose for ourselves.    
af_caves_load,60,63.4,^2Price: ^7We go forward like a breath exhaled from the Earth.  
af_caves_load,64,66.7,^2Price: ^7With vigor in our hearts and one goal in sight:
af_caves_load,67.8,69.5,^2Price: ^7We.  Will. 
af_caves_load,70,72,^2Price: ^7Kill him.  
af_chase_load,16.3,18,^2Price: ^7This is for the record.
af_chase_load,18.3,21,^2Price: ^7History is written by the victor.
af_chase_load,22,24,^2Price: ^7History is filled with liars. 
af_chase_load,25,30,^2Price: ^7If he lives and we die, his truth becomes written -  
af_chase_load,30,32,^2Price: ^7- and ours is lost.
af_chase_load,32,39,^2Price: ^7Shepherd will be a hero.  'Cause all you need to change the world is one good lie and a river of blood.
af_chase_load,40,45,^2Price: ^7He's about to complete the greatest trick a liar ever played on history.
af_chase_load,45.7,48,^2Price: ^7His truth will be the truth.
af_chase_load,48,52.2,^2Price: ^7But only if he lives, and we die.
airport_load,7.5,11,^2Shepherd: ^7The rest of Task Force 141 brought in the ACS, Allen.  
airport_load,12,16,^2Shepherd: ^7Two men took down an entire base.  I ask much more from you now.  
airport_load,18,23,^2Shepherd: ^7Yesterday you were a soldier on the front lines.  But today front lines are history.  
airport_load,23,29,^2Shepherd: ^7Uniforms are relics.  The war rages everywhere.  And there will be casualties. 
airport_load,36,41,^2Shepherd: ^7This man Makarov is fighting his own war and he has no rules.  No boundaries.  
airport_load,41,44.3,^2Shepherd: ^7He doesn't flinch at torture, human trafficking, or genocide.
airport_load,45,52,^2Shepherd: ^7He's not loyal to a flag or a country or any set of ideals.  He trades blood for money.   
airport_load,53,55,^2Shepherd: ^7He's your new best friend. 
airport_load,56,59.3,^2Shepherd: ^7You don't want to know what it's cost already to put you next to him.
airport_load,60,62.6,^2Shepherd: ^7It will cost you a piece of yourself.
airport_load,64,67,^2Shepherd: ^7It will cost nothing compared to everything you'll save. 
arcadia_load,25,27.2,^2Shepherd: ^7Someone turn off that damn TV.
arcadia_load,29,33,^2Shepherd: ^7My Task Force is out of the country.  I'm commandeering your unit, Sergeant Foley.
arcadia_load,34,36,^2Sgt. Foley: ^7Yes, Sir.  All yours, Sir.
arcadia_load,37,40,^2Shepherd: ^7I've requisitioned a Stryker from the Eighth Armored.
arcadia_load,46,48,^2Sgt. Foley: ^7Honey Badger's a mean bitch, Sir.
arcadia_load,48,52,^2Shepherd: ^7She'll walk you in.  The Russians are burning through our defenses and our intel.  
arcadia_load,52,54,^2Shepherd: ^7Can't let 'em take this corner.
arcadia_load,54.6,58.3,^2Sgt. Foley: ^7Just point it out on the map, Sir. They won't take it.  
boneyard_load,16.7,20,^2MacTavish: ^7Roach? Ghost? Come in, Ghost! Do you copy?  Does anyone copy?
boneyard_load,20,25,^2Price: ^7They're dead, Soap.  Shepherd's cleaning house.  I'm working my way back to you. 
boneyard_load,26,28,^2MacTavish: ^7Shepherd betrayed us. 
boneyard_load,28,31,^2Price: ^7Have to trust someone to be betrayed.  I never did.   
boneyard_load,31.3,34,^2Price: ^7Nikolai, come in.  Do you have our location? 
boneyard_load,34,38,^2Nikolai: ^7Da.  Inbound, Price.  But I am not the only one. 
boneyard_load,38,41,^2Nikolai: ^7You've got Shepherd's men on one side, Makarov's on the other.  
boneyard_load,43,45,^2Price: ^7We'll have to take them all out then.     
boneyard_load,45,47,^2Nikolai: ^7Or let them take each other out.  
boneyard_load,47,50,^2Nikolai: ^7Either way, I'll see you on the other side my friend.  
cliffhanger_load,23.3,25,^2PFC Allen: ^7So how do I look?  
cliffhanger_load,25,27,^2Shepherd: ^7Like one of the bad guys.
cliffhanger_load,27,29,^2Shepherd: ^7Perfect for your undercover assignment.  
cliffhanger_load,29,31,^2PFC Allen: ^7So Makarov is the prize. 
cliffhanger_load,31,36,^2Shepherd: ^7Makarov's no prize. He's a whore. A mad-dog killer for the highest bidder.
cliffhanger_load,37,40,^2Shepherd: ^7Just remember your new identity. It'll keep you alive.  
cliffhanger_load,41,45.5,^2Shepherd: ^7Welcome to the 141.  Best handpicked group of warriors on the planet.      
cliffhanger_load,46,49,^2PFC Allen: ^7It's an honor, Sir. When do I meet the rest of the team?   
cliffhanger_load,49.3,53.5,^2Shepherd: ^7They're on a mission recovering a downed ACS module behind enemy lines.   
cliffhanger_load,54,56,^2PFC Allen: ^7Their feet wet? 
cliffhanger_load,56,59,^2Shepherd: ^7Imagine they're just about freezing right now.

contingency_load,12,14,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Uplink nearly complete. 
contingency_load,16.3,19,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7General Shepherd you're online with Captain Price.    
contingency_load,20,22,^2Shepherd: ^7Back from the brink, Captain.   
contingency_load,22,24,^2Captain Price: ^7"Out of the frying pan" is more like it. 
contingency_load,24,27,^2Captain Price: ^7This world looks more like hell than the one I just left. 
contingency_load,28,31,^2Shepherd: ^7We thought we'd recovered the ACS before the Russians could crack it. 
contingency_load,32,33,^2Shepherd: ^7We were wrong. 
contingency_load,33.6,38,^2Shepherd: ^7Then Makarov turned the U.S. into his scapegoat.  Next thing you know there's flames everywhere. 
contingency_load,39,41,^2Shepherd: ^7What's this image you're sending me?
contingency_load,41.6,46,^2Captain Price: ^7You wanna put out an oil fire, Sir, you set off a bigger explosion right next to it.
contingency_load,46,48.2,^2Captain Price: ^7Sucks away the oxygen.  Snuffs the flame.  
contingency_load,49,54,^2Shepherd: ^7Price, you been locked away too long. Better get your mind right, son.   
contingency_load,55,58,^2Captain Price: ^7Shepherd, are you willing to do what is necessary to win? 
contingency_load,58.6,60,^2Shepherd: ^7Always. 
contingency_load,60.5,65,^2Captain Price: ^7We got ourselves a pretty big fire. Gonna need a huge bang.   
contingency_load,66,70.2,^2Shepherd: ^7You've been in the gulag too long, Price.  Focus on taking out Makarov.     
contingency_load,71,73,^2Captain Price: ^7No time, Sir.  We need to end this war today.      
contingency_load,73,76,^2Shepherd: ^7I'm not asking you, Price.  This is an order!  You're to...
contingency_load,79,82,^2Captain Price: ^7Looks like we lost our connection.  
dcburning_load,7,44,^2 ^7
dcemp_load,27,31.5,^2SecDef: ^7Gentlemen, the missile's vector puts it en route to the East Coast.  We will lose the White House.   
dcemp_load,32,35,^2Shepherd: ^7We've rebuilt it before, we'll rebuild it again.   
dcemp_load,36,37,^2SecDef: ^7Casualties?
dcemp_load,37.8,45,^2Shepherd: ^7Possibly 30,000 to 50,000.  Depends on the exact location of the detonation.  All systems will go down.     
dcemp_load,46,49,^2SecDef: ^7General Shepherd, you warned us. We should've listened.    
dcemp_load,49.5,55,^2Shepherd: ^7When they speak of this moment, we will not be the ones who stood guard while America died.
dcemp_load,55.2,61,^2Shepherd: ^7One man is responsible for all this. Makarov must be brought to light. 
dcemp_load,61.8,65,^2SecDef: ^7Whatever you need, General.  You've got a blank check.   
estate_load,7,12,^2Shepherd: ^7It's been a tough week, gentlemen. We've lost more than we ever dreamed.  But we will recover.  
estate_load,16,20.3,
^2Shepherd: ^7I've got a blank check.  And we're gonna use every cent of it killin' Makarov.     
estate_load,22,28,^2Shepherd: ^7Despite what the world may say, we are not savages, we don't kill civilians. We use precision. 
estate_load,30,34,^2Shepherd: ^7There's an evil man hiding in these shadows and we're gonna bring him into the light. 
estate_load,34.7,38,^2Shepherd: ^7Once his face is revealed, we will write history, gentlemen.    
estate_load,42.5,46.2,^2Shepherd: ^7These are the last safe havens left on Earth for Makarov and his men.     
estate_load,47,49.3,^2Captain Price: ^7Sounds like we gotta be in two places at once.     
estate_load,50,51,^2Shepherd: ^7Impossible? 
estate_load,51,53,^2Captain Price: ^7Not for the One-Four-One. 
estate_load,53,55.4,^2Ghost: ^7Fifty-fifty chance to take out Makarov, eh? 
estate_load,56,59,^2Ghost: ^7Captain Price, request permission to take the safehouse with Roach. 
estate_load,59.8,63,^2Captain Price: ^7Granted. Soap and I will take the boneyard in Afghanistan. 
estate_load,63.3,69,^2Shepherd: ^7Very well. We will cut off all avenues of escape.  This ends now.
estate_load,70,74,^2Captain Price: ^7Strange.  I coulda sworn we ended this war yesterday.  
favela_escape_load,28.3,30.5,^2Ghost: ^7I can't get anyone on the horn. 
favela_escape_load,38,42.5,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7The Russians must've copied the ACS module. Got the key to every lock in America.    
favela_escape_load,42.5,48,^2Ghost: ^7And they're killing a thousand Americans for every dead civilian in Moscow.  Looks like we're all outta friends.   
favela_escape_load,49.2,52,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7I know a guy.  Let's find a payphone.  They still exist? 
favela_escape_load,53.3,59,^2Ghost: ^7All we got outta Rojas is that the only guy Makarov hates worse than Americans is locked up in a gulag. 
favela_escape_load,59.5,65,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7It's all we got.  If this con's the bait to catch that psychopath, let's hang him from a tree.   
favela_load,13,16.5,
^2Ghost: ^7The Russians ain't gonna let this massacre go unanswered. It's gonna get bloody.
favela_load,17,20,
^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Too right, mate. Now, in the eyes of the world, they're the victims.
favela_load,20,24.3,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7No one's gonna say a word when the Russians club every American they can reach.
favela_load,24.3,30,^2Shepherd: ^7Makarov was one move ahead.  Now he's left thousands of bodies at the feet of an American.
favela_load,31,36.6,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7We're the only ones who know it was Makarov's op.  Our credibility died with Allen.  We need proof.  
favela_load,37.3,39.3,^2Shepherd: ^7Follow the shell.
favela_load,45,47,^2Shepherd: ^7Alejandro Rojas.
favela_load,48.5,50,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Never heard of him, Sir.   
favela_load,50,53,^2Shepherd: ^7You know him as Alex the Red.  He supplied the assault.    
favela_load,54.5,59,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7One bullet to unleash the fury of a whole nation.  Which means...
favela_load,59,61,^2Shepherd: ^7He's our ticket to Makarov.
gulag_load,16,19,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Sixth Fleet's mopping up.  Time to move in.   
gulag_load,20.7,24,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Long history, this building.  Not much of it pretty.    
gulag_load,24,28,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Started out as a castle.  With an actual dungeon.  Built to withstand any siege. 
gulag_load,28.8,33.2,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Building survived every brutal winter.  The occupants... they weren't so lucky.    
gulag_load,34,37,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7The Monastery.  Didn't survive the Purges.
gulag_load,37,41,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Over the last century it's played host to anyone the government didn't want, but couldn't kill.  
gulag_load,43,48,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Place is filled with living casualties of the last war... which I swear I thought we'd won. 
gulag_load,48,53,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7But I suppose it's all a day at the races: you back the losing horse, and this is where you end up. 
gulag_load,53.8,58,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Six-Two-Seven is the piece of meat Makarov wants, so let's cut him loose. 
invasion_load,22,26,^2NORAD HQ: ^7Sand Bravo, we're reading 70 bogeys in your sector, please verify.   
invasion_load,27,31.5,^2Nome AFB: ^7Very funny, Station.  That's a big negative, over.
invasion_load,34,38,^2NORAD HQ: ^7Sand Bravo, be advised, running diagnostics to scan for malfunction. 
invasion_load,39,42.2,^2Nome AFB: ^7The skies are clear, Station.  You got yourself some phantom dots.  Over. 
invasion_load,43,48,^2NORAD HQ: ^7Zulu X-Ray 6.  Signs in your sector of some 100 bogeys, please advise.  
invasion_load,49,55,^2Vandenberg AFB: ^7Negatory, Station.  Scope is clear. I dunno what to tell ya.  Solar interference?  Heavy sunspot activity today.     
invasion_load,55.8,61,^2NORAD HQ: ^7Sierra Delta, uh... we may have a minor ACS fault here. Do you have anything on your scope?
invasion_load,61.3,63,^2Air Traffic Controller: ^7They're everywhere!
invasion_load,63,65,^2NORAD HQ: ^7Sierra Delta, repeat! 
invasion_load,65,69,^2Air Traffic Controller: ^7I'm lookin' at fighter jets over I-95!  How the hell did they get through?   
invasion_load,69,73,^2NORAD HQ: ^7Standby!  Attempting to contact the nearest unit in that sector.
invasion_load,73,79,^2Sgt. Foley: ^7I read you.  This is First Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Sergeant Foley, acting commander of Hunter Two-One. Do you copy over? 
invasion_load,79,87,^2NORAD HQ: ^7All stations, be advised - satellite surveillance has been disabled. SOSUS and Pave Paws arrays are inoperative at this time.
oilrig_load,20.8,24,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Seems we're headed the wrong direction, Sir.  Shouldn't we be coming back to the fight? 
oilrig_load,24,26,^2Shepherd: ^7Plenty of fight to go around, MacTavish. 
oilrig_load,27,33,^2Shepherd: ^7Glad you made it outta South America.  You're meeting up with the 6th Fleet.  Leadin' the counter-strike. 
oilrig_load,35,42,^2Shepherd: ^7Prisoner Six-Two-Seven.  We believe that's who Makarov's got the mad-on for.  But we can't get to him. 
oilrig_load,45,47,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7Oilrigs, Sir? 
oilrig_load,47,49,^2Shepherd: ^7Russians are using them as SAM sites.   
oilrig_load,50,56,^2Shepherd: ^7Oil workers are human shields, so we can't just blow up the rigs wholesale.  And this one is the least defended.  
oilrig_load,58.8,62,^2Shepherd: ^7Boys, I know I'm sending you into the meat grinder on this one...
oilrig_load,62,67,^2Captain MacTavish: ^7They're defending it, so it means we want it.  Especially if it gets us to Six-Two-Seven.   
roadkill_load,31,35.3,^2Shepherd: ^7We are the most powerful military force in the history of man.
roadkill_load,36,38,^2Shepherd: ^7Every fight is our fight.  
roadkill_load,39,45,^2Shepherd: ^7Because what happens over here, matters over there. We don't get to sit one out.    
roadkill_load,46,53,^2Shepherd: ^7Learning to use the tools of modern warfare is the difference between the prospering of your people, and utter destruction. 
roadkill_load,54.5,60,^2Shepherd: ^7We can't give you freedom.  But we can give you the know-how to acquire it.  
roadkill_load,60,65,^2Shepherd: ^7And that, my friends, is worth more than a whole army base of steel.  
roadkill_load,65.8,71,^2Shepherd: ^7Sure it matters who's got the biggest stick, but it matters a helluva lot more who's swinging it.  
roadkill_load,73,77,^2Shepherd: ^7This is a time for heroes.  A time for legends.   
roadkill_load,78,80,^2Shepherd: ^7History is written by the victors.
roadkill_load,81,83,^2Shepherd: ^7Let's get to work.
trainer_load,10.7,14,^2Shepherd: ^7The more things change, the more they stay the same.    
trainer_load,15,21,^2Shepherd: ^7Boundaries shift, new players step in, but power always finds a place to rest its head. 
trainer_load,24,29,^2Shepherd: ^7We fought and bled alongside the Russians.  We shoulda known they'd hate us for it.   
trainer_load,30,35,^2Shepherd: ^7History is written by the victor. And here I am, thinking we'd won.  
trainer_load,37,41,^2Shepherd: ^7But you bring down one enemy and they find someone even worse to replace him. 
trainer_load,43.8,48,^2Shepherd: ^7Locations change, the rationale, the objective.  
trainer_load,49,52,^2Shepherd: ^7Yesterday's enemies are today's recruits.  
trainer_load,52,59,^2Shepherd: ^7Train them to fight alongside you, and pray they don't eventually decide to hate you for it too.   
trainer_load,70,72,^2Shepherd: ^7Same shit, different day. 
trainer_load,72.8,77,^2Shepherd: ^7You know what I'm looking for, Sergeant Foley.  Keep your eyes open. 
trainer_load,78,82,^2Sgt. Foley: ^7Got a new batch hittin' The Pit today, Sir.  I'll send you the best I find.
