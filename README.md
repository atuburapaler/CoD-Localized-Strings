Compilation of **Localized Strings** from **Call of Duty** games. _Currently using English & Spanish (Spain/LATAM)_.

# Games
> This repository is constantly growing, so this list is not definitive. New content is added regularly.
* **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2** (2009)
* **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3** (2011)
* **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered** (2016)
* **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered** (2020)
* **Call of Duty: World at War** (2008)
* **Call of Duty: Black Ops** (2010)
* **Call of Duty: Black Ops II** (2012)
  
# Notes
* In order to edit string files that contain **Latin characters** (such as Spanish), save the file first in the **[ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) (Western) encoder** to avoid breaking characters. *This applies to games **previous than Black Ops II**, as that game uses **[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)**.*
* **Black Ops II** only has **subtitles on English**, they were not translated by [Keywords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords_Studios) to Spanish since **the game doesn't use them**.
* Some newer dumps can contain space errors and legal/terms stuff missing.
* Since most of the **Remastered** games share strings with their original counterparts, i added only one the missing localizations (Spanish LATAM).
