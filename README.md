Compilation of **Localized Strings** from **Call of Duty** games. _Currently using English & Spanish (Spain/LATAM)_.

# Games
> This repository is constantly growing, so this list is not definitive. New content is added regularly.
* **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2** (2009)
* **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3** (2011)
* **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered** (2016)
* **Call of Duty: World at War** (2008)
* **Call of Duty: Black Ops** (2010)
* **Call of Duty: Black Ops II** (2012)
  
# Notes
* If you are editing strings that contain **Latin characters** (such as Spanish), please first save the file in the **ISO 8859-1 (Western) encoder**.
  (This applies to any game **older than Black Ops II**, as T6 uses **UTF-8**).
* **Black Ops II** only has **subtitles on English**, they were not translated by Keywords to Spanish since **the game doesn't use them**.
* Some newer dumps can contain space errors and legal/terms stuff missing.
* Since most of the **Remastered** games share strings with their original counterparts, i added only the missing languages (Spanish LATAM).
